                    The next step was to secure organizational buy‐in and build up the right talent.  This step 
                    is crucial, because if key stakeholders aren’t ready to accept data‐driven insights, then all 
                    the work ahead may be for naught.  A classic example is the initial resistance to data 
                    analytics in sports, where general managers and scouts scoffed at the idea of computer 
                    algorithms outsmarting their years of experience and tribal knowledge.  We used other 
                    Intel AI solution briefs and customer testimonials get buy‐in, as well as ensure that the 
                    organization was ready to embrace the fact that AI development is different, involving 
                    more trial & error and uncertainty than traditional software development. Next, we
                    assessed the talent situation and determined that training up existing
                    developers through Intel’s free AI developer program was the best approach.
